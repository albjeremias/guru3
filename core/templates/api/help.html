<h1>Eventphone power user API</h1>

<p>
    Our power users (such as OCs) often asked us if we can support their workflows with a
    way to programmatically access and modify extensions and call groups. The API enables you
    to, for example, enable and disable call group members automatically when a shift changes
    or automatically configure people with delay if they act as fallback based on your internal
    time planning. Modification of extensions (call forwarding) is planned but will come a bit later.
</p>

<p>
    The following API endpoints currently exist:
<ul>
    <li><a href="#callgroup.api">Callgroup membership management</a></li>
    <li><a href="#callgroup.member.api">Callgroup member detail</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>General API conventions</h2>
<h3>API authentication</h3>

<p>
    All API endpoints can be accessed by setting an <code>ApiKey</code> header field with a user API key.
    You can create/renew your (personalized) API key in your <a href="{% url "user.profile" %}">profile</a>.
    Please note that the API key authentication mechanism can only be used in the <code>/api/â€¦</code> URL space
    of guru3 and is otherwise ignored.
</p>

<h3>Unique object URLs</h3>

<p>
    In order to prevent misinterpretation in situations with multiple upcoming or (even) concurrently running
    events, the resource identifiers contain the event id in which the extension/callgroup etc lives. See the list
    below for currently relevant event IDs.
</p>
<h4>Event IDs</h4>
<ul>
    {% for event in runningEvents %}
    <li>{{event.name}}: {{event.pk}}</li>
    {% endfor %}
    {% for event in upcomingEvents %}
    <li>{{event.name}}: {{event.pk}}</li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>

<h3>Data formats</h3>
<p>
    The API is JSON-based. All data requested via HTTP <code>GET</code> will be returned in JSON format. All data
    that is submitted in HTTP <code>POST</code> or <code>PUT</code> needs to be in json as well and must be announced
    with a <code>Content-type: appplication/json</code> header or will otherwise be rejected.
</p>
<p>
    All JSON inputs to the API endpoints will be checked against a <a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a>.
    The respective schemas that are used for validation are linked in the API endpoint documentation.
</p>

<h3 id="semantic-data-validation">Semantic data validation</h3>
<p>
    Some endpoints do semantic input validation in addition to the json-schema based syntactic validation.
    This is analog to HTML input form validation that can give you an error if inputs are invalid. If your
    request fails semantic validation, the API will return <code>HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity</code>. The
    response body will be json and gives you more information about what is going wrong.
</p>
<p>
    The error information is a dictionary that (at least) has a key called "validation_errors". This is (again)
    a dictionary that contains the errors for the fields that failed input validation. For each field, there is a
    list of all problems that occurred while validation. The errors themselves are dictionaries with a human
    readable "message" and a machine interpretable error "code".
</p>
<h5>Example</h5>
<pre>
{
  "validation_errors": {
    "extension": [
      {
        "message": "Adding this extension creates a loop: 2000 -> 2050",
        "code": "extension-creates-loop"
      }
    ]
  }
}
</pre>



<h2 id="callgroup.api">Callgroup membership management endpoint</h2>
<dl>
    <dt>Endpoint</dt>
    <dd><code>/api/event/&lt;event_id&gt;/callgroup/&lt;callgroup_extension&gt;</code> </dd>
    <dt>Allowed HTTP methods</dt>
    <dd><code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code></dd>
    <dt>Permissions</dt>
    <dd>
        <ul>
            <li>Members of the callgroup: View</li>
            <li>Call group admins: View/Modify active state and delay</li>
            <li>Call group owner: View list of admins</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt>JSONSchema</dt>
    <dd><a href="{% url "callgroup.api.schema" %}">{{guru_url}}{% url "callgroup.api.schema" %}</a></dd>
</dl>

<h3>View member list</h3>
The <code>GET</code> method can be used to retrieve a list of all members. This can be used by all members (even if
they haven't confirmed their membership yet) and admins. The call group owner additionally gets a list of call group
administrators.

<h4>Example output</h4>
<pre>
{
  "members": {
    "2042": {
      "accepted": true,
      "active": true,
      "delay_s": 0,
      "invite_reason": "Please join the test group"
    },
    "2001": {
      "accepted": false,
      "active": false,
      "delay_s": 10,
      "invite_reason": "Join our amazing test group!"
    }
  },
  "admins": [
    "garwin",
    "sascha"
  ]
}
</pre>
<h3>Modify member properties</h3>
<p>
    Call group administrators can <code>POST</code> a similar structure to the output of <code>GET</code> to modify the
    <code>active</code> and the <code>delay_s</code> parameter of the respective member. If members do not appear
    in the posted data, they are left unchanged. In the same way, you may also only post one of the parameters to
    only modify this one and leave the other unchanged.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that this interface can neither be used to add new members to a callgroup nor to remove members from
    the group.
</p>
<p>
    You can set these attributes irrespective of the acceptance state of invites. However, they will (of course)
    only take effect once the membership to the call group is accepted.
</p>

<h2 id="callgroup.member.api">Callgroup member detail endpoint</h2>
<dl>
    <dt>Endpoint</dt>
    <dd><code>/api/event/&lt;event_id&gt;/callgroup/&lt;callgroup_extension&gt;/member/&lt;extension&gt;</code> </dd>
    <dt>Allowed HTTP methods</dt>
    <dd><code>GET</code>, <code>PUT/POST</code>, <code>DELETE</code></dd>
    <dt>Permissions</dt>
    <dd>
        <ul>
            <li>Members of the callgroup: Accept invites, Pause/Unpause themselves</li>
            <li>Call group admins: Invite members, Delete members, Edit member details</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt>JSONSchema</dt>
    <dd><a href="{% url "callgroup.member.api.schema" %}">{{guru_url}}{% url "callgroup.member.api.schema" %}</a></dd>
</dl>

<h3>View member details</h3>

A callgroup administrator can <code>GET</code> details on all members. Regular members can only request their
own details. The response looks like this
<pre>
{
  "accepted": false,
  "active": false,
  "delay_s": 10,
  "invite_reason": "Join our amazing test group!"
}
</pre>

<h3>Create/update member details</h3>
<p>The structure as shown above can be <code>POST</code>ed or <code>PUT</code> to the same URL to create a call group
    membership or update it if it already exists.</p>

<p>
    Call group administrators can create a membership invite by posting with <code>&lt;extension&gt;</code>
    set to the new member. In this case, the <code>accepted</code> property must either be set to <code>false</code>
    or not exist at all. Moreover, the <code>invite_reason</code> needs to be set.</p>
<p>
    Creating a new member may cause errors if the target extension does not exist in this event or if inviting
    this member would cause an include-loop!. The former will cause an HTTP 404 code, the latter an HTTP 422 error.
    (see <a href="#semantic-data-validation">Semantic data validation</a>)
    If the invite was successfully created, the API returns HTTP code 201.
</p>

<p>
    For already existing entries, call group adminstrators can update the <code>active</code> and <code>delay_s</code>
    properties. The member itself can turn <code>accepted</code> to true or modify their own <code>active</code> state.
</p>

<h3>Delete members</h3>
Either a member themself or a call group administrator can terminate the membership with an HTTP <code>DELETE</code>
request.
